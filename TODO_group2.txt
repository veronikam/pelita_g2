Hello fellow members of group 2!

A summary of the discussion on Thursday about what we should/could do:

--strategy field
decide which strategy to use, depending on the score and position of the bots
players should try to be away from each other?

--implement a food eating strategy

--implement a defending strategy

--implement time-out prevention
a basic example of this is given on the wiki

--implement benchmarking 
test players against each other in a number of test games
